      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>My family has had a computer and the internet since I was a little kid. My dad worked as a programmer his entire career. I learned about the command line and how to do a few commands before I formally learned to type in grade school. I was homeschooled, attended community college, earned my GED, and worked 7 years in IT Helpdesk and Desktop Support. I enrolled at Epicodus for the focused time, structured curriculum, and supporting community to learn how to develop websites and break into Software Engineering.</p>
      
      <p>Things I like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open Source, Linux and the BSDs: <a href="https://openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>, <a href="https://freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a>, and others.</li>
        <li>Road cycling and acoustic guitar (once I have more free time again).</li>
        <li>Spending time with my wife and son.</li>
      </ul>
